# GateKeep
Keep your discord server safe with this free and open-source file-scanning bot using the Cloudmersive virus scanning API

## Info

This is version 1.1, it is not secure. If you deploy it without changes your bot and Cloudmersive API tokens will be public. Cloudmersive requires an account and is free up to 800 calls.
Just so you know, this bot will download ALL files posted in your discord server. This opens you up to the virus you are trying to protect your server against. I recommend that this code runs on a remote server with precautions in place.

## To do

1. Incorporate dotenv secruity
2. Add in link scanning (Some of the code is already there)

## Dependencies

GateKeep is dependent on the packages in requirements.txt

**To run this program you must CD to the location you downloaded this repository to and run**
> pip install -r requirements.txt

You may need to use pip3 instead of pip, depending on OS and how you installed Python.

For more info on these dependencies, I recommend reading their documentation, it was super helpful when I was building this bot.

## Update Log

Version 1.1:
  Bug fixes, logic fixes, and improvements. This bot is plug-and-play, with the above security warnings in mind.
