# GateKeep
Keep your discord server safe with this free and open-source file-scanning bot using the Cloudmersive virus scanning API

## Info
This is version 1, it is not secure. If you deploy it without changes your bot and Cloudmersive API tokens will be public. Cloudmersive requires an account and is free up to 800 calls. Any more then I suggest paying for the premium versions.

## To do

1. Incorporate dotenv secruity
2. Add in link scanning (Some of the code is already there)

## Dependencies

GateKeep is dependent on the following Python packages

* asyncio
* time
* discord
* os
* cloudmersive_virus_api_client
* dotenv

pip3 install all of the above to run this script

For more info on these dependencies, I recommend reading their documentation, it was super helpful when I was building this bot.
